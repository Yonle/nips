## Removed NIPs

This file will document every NIPs that i remove with reasons.

Some NIPs that's removed may be only useful on very specific cases.

|NIP|Kind(s)|Tag(s)|Reason|
|---|-------|------|------|
|[NIP-03: OpenTimestamps Attestations for Events](03.md)|`1040`|-|Meaningless. Truly meaningless crap that i won't understand the real usage on nostr. Like, Is `created_at` not enough to determine when an shitpost was created?|
|[NIP-13: Proof of Work](13.md)|-|`nonce`|You call this an "solution for nostr spam", But i think this is only for "area 51 top secret document", BUT WE AIN'T AREA 51 CRABS, HECK, IT'S NOT EVEN SOLVING THE SPAM PROBLEM|
|[NIP-55: Android Signer Application](55.md)|-|-|Terrible Implementation that's ruining UX. Just use [NIP-46: Nostr Remote Signing](46.md) instead smh|

*P.S. I was about to remove A LOT OF NIPs, And then i realized that they probably have potentials, So here, I am removing meaningless, or terrible NIPs.*
